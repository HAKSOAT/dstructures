The `dstructures` project is an implementation of data structures as I get to learn about them. 

I intend implementing the data structures from [this list](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_data_structures).

So far, I have implemented the following data structures:

* Linear Data Structures

  * Array
  * Bit Array
  * [Bit Field](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bit_field) (Looks like more of a C, C++ thing; so I am yet to wrap my head around how to implement such in Python.
  I'd appreciate some help.)
  * Bitboard: [Link](http://pages.cs.wisc.edu/~psilord/blog/data/chess-pages/rep.html)
  * Bitmap (This is the same as a Bit array)
  * Circular Buffer: [Link](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Circular_buffer)
